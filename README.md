## LCOUNT

This project is a utility binary for retrieving line counts for projects.

**While it is functional, this is not meant to be the fastest/more complete implementation at all.
It was created for some Rust fun ðŸ¦€ and for learning purposes. if you want something like this but way more powerful look up [SCC](https://github.com/boyter/scc) by Ben Boyter.**

## Installation

For now you need to build it with rustc/cargo yourself and add the binary to your path.

I will make it available either on github or via package managers (maybe).

## Examples

Examples are made by using this repo as a source.

`git clone https://github.com/lpturmel/lcount`

1. Retrieve all lines inside a directory

`lcount ./lcount`

2. Retrieve all lines of rust code inside a directory

`lcount ./lcount --extension=rs`
